        About content design
    </h1>
    <p class="lede">
        Content designers make sure that the writing on a site or service meets the needs of the user (or customer) as clearly, simply and quickly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        They make complex language and processes easy to understand. They think about the whole interaction, not just the words. And they work very closely with designers to build services together.
    </p>
    <p>
        Content designers base their decisions on evidence and data, such as user research and site analytics. As with the other design roles, their output is tested with users, whose feedback helps them to improve the service further.
